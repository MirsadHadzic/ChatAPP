# ChatApp
Making a ChatAPP as a project for Software Engineering. 

Team members: Almir Alic and Hadzic Mirsad

Project Description: 
	
	The project is a global and private chat application that allows people to connect 
	with each other and communicate in real-time. We decided to develop this app because 
	we wanted to create a platform where people from different parts of the world can come together and 
	exchange ideas, thoughts, and experiences. Additionally, we wanted to challenge ourselves to learn and explore 
	new technologies while building something that could potentially benefit others.

List of main planned features: 

1. Adding user: Adding user to the database and giving him/her a (secret) name.
2. Private and group chat: Allow users to send and receive private messages with each other, 
   as well as join global chat.
3. Real-time messaging: Implement real-time messaging using Firebase to ensure messages are delivered instantly.
4. Online/offline status: Show the online/offline status of users to let them know when their friends are available to chat.
5. Push notifications: Send push notifications to users when they receive new private messages or when someone joins the ChatAPP.
6. Emoji: Allow users to send emojis in their chats.

Technologies (programming languages and/or frameworks ) that will be used:

    Dart: A client-optimized programming language used to build applications for mobile, web, and desktop.

    Flutter: An open-source UI software development kit (SDK) created by Google for building natively 
	compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop using a single codebase.

    Firebase: A mobile and web application development platform created by Google that provides 
	a variety of services including authentication, real-time databases, cloud storage, and messaging.
	
Coding standard that will be used:

For Dart, the coding standard is called the Dart Style Guide, which provides guidelines on code layout, 
naming, documentation, and more. The guide can be found on the official Dart website.

For Flutter, the coding standard is based on the Dart Style Guide, and Flutter-specific conventions and 
guidelines are documented in the Flutter Style Guide, which can also be found on the official Flutter website.
